Mapping_Earthquakes Overview

This challenged used data visualization to show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes around the world over the last seven days.  With the use of D3 and Leaflet libraries, and GeoJSON, an interactive earthquake map was created using three overlay maps.

The first map added tectonic plate data to the existing earthquake data and displayed when the page was loaded.  Next, major earthquake data was added, and each dataset could be toggled on or off.  Finally, a dark map style was added a tile layer object and map variable to show the final map (below).
